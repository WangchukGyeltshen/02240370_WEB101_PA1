## Component Architecture

The application uses a **modular component structure** to ensure reusability and maintainability. Below is a breakdown of the components:

### 1. **Navbar.js**
   - **Functionality**: Displays the navigation links and authentication buttons at the top of the page. It includes links such as *Photo + Video Editor*, *Photography Community*, and *Business + Brand Exposure*.
   - **Responsive**: The navigation adapts to mobile and desktop views.

### 2. **Sidebar.js**
   - **Functionality**: Displays the main navigation links for the platform, including sections like *Feed*, *Studio*, *Canvas*, *Profile*, and *Search*. It also contains the sign-up and log-in buttons at the bottom.
   - **Responsive**: On larger screens, it is always visible. On mobile screens, it is hidden and toggled via the **ResponsiveDrawer** component.

### 3. **ResponsiveDrawer.js**
   - **Functionality**: A mobile-friendly sidebar that appears when the user clicks on the menu icon. It provides the same navigation links as the sidebar but is optimized for mobile use.
   - **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` hook to manage the open/closed state of the drawer.

### 4. **MainContent.js**
   - **Functionality**: Contains the main content area of the page, including the **Hero Section** and **Feature Cards**.
   - **Hero Section**: Displays a welcoming title, tagline, and buttons for the user to interact with (e.g., "Try for Free" and "Sign In").
   - **Feature Cards**: Displays key features of the platform (e.g., *Photo Editor*, *VSCO Canvas*, etc.) as visually appealing cards.

### 5. **Footer.js**
   - **Functionality**: A footer that includes copyright information and additional links like *Support*, *Privacy*, and *Terms*.

### 6. **HeroSection.js**
   - **Functionality**: A reusable section for the main call-to-action (CTA). It provides the introductory text and main action buttons.

### 7. **FeatureCards.js**
   - **Functionality**: Displays a grid of cards, each representing a key feature or service offered on the platform. Each card includes an image and title.


## Key Technologies Used

- **Next.js 13**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used for styling the components.
- **Lucide Icons**: Used for vector icons in the navigation and buttons.
- **React Hooks**: Used for managing state (`useState`) in components like `ResponsiveDrawer`.
